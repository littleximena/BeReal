App Ideas:
===

## DailyStride:

**What**: An application that is used to complete and share tasks such as study groups, stream party events, and general group work.

**Who**: From the general public to professionals, individuals need tools to organize their method of working in order to complete their tasks.

**Why**: Users need to have an outlet to share activities that other users can partake on and share around with friends.

**Challenges**: Developing a network of friends and allowing for each individual to interact with the tasks that are created by other friends.

## Walkies: 
**What**: The app is for users that want to take walls along with their friends. There is a competitive factor where users can share themselves in a leader board for different categories such as walking speed, running speed, total miles ran, etc.

**Who**: The app is for users that are exercising in the form of cardio that involves outdoor walking, running, etc.

**Why**: We are building this app to fit the niche community of runners and walkers that need to share their weekly goals of running and walking.

**Challenges**: Potential challenges could be networking the scores to ther users as well as integrating the app to show the map to the users from their starting point to their ending point.

## Smarties

**What**: IoT centered device manager that is capable of housing different devices and interfacing them according to their needs.

**Who**: Millions of house owners would benefit from having a generic profile of devices that they can check battery life, activity, and general information in a single application hub.

**Why**: The purpose of this project would be to have a generic profile for users to set up their devices.

**Challenges**: Transferring data from these devices, especially since different companies could hide this information instead of providing it freely.

## Wreck Watcher
**What**: An application used to track where and when accidents are reported through a peer to peer report system.

**Who**: General users that gain access to this app can use it to prevent wasting their time on congested traffic.

**Why**: Due to an influx of workers on the road, such as from Uber or Doordash, having a traffic watch app would allow for more efficient hand off deliveries as well as less congested traffic.

**Challenges**: Some users may not report enough data to provide enough information about the state of traffic. Traffic may be missed reported by users in order to cause misdirection of traffic. APIs and open source documentation may be needed to fully implement the application.

## Live:
**What**: API driven platform where users can check the current top live accounts in a single platform and have a link to that platform.

**Who**: People that watch streams would be interested in seeing when and what is popping in the different media sites through a single app.

**Why**: By organizing the hits of different streaming sites, users can get real time information of their favorite streamers going live as well as new and interesting streams in different platforms.

**Challenges**: While some sites can be scavenged for information on their currently live users, some sites may hide that information from their APIs.
